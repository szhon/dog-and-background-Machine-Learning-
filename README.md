# dog-and-background-Machine-Learning

we will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify Prateekâ€™s dog images by breed, where the breed associated with each image serves as the classification label. We will then explore supervised pretraining, a type of transfer learning that will use a feature representation learned on a related task to aug- ment our classification abilities. Finally, we will experiment with data augmentation to enrich our training data and improve the robustness of our models.
